                    <p>
                        Factory of Art emerged from the dynamic collaboration between photographer Monica Silva and
                        designer Valerio Fausti. Their mission is clear: to transcend the limitations of their
                        respective fields and create a "forge of freedom." Driven by a passion for uncovering hidden
                        beauty, they push beyond the obvious, exploring deeper and thinking outside the box. Their
                        innovative approach is fresh, unexpected, and captivating. Every project is meticulously
                        crafted, where nothing is left to chance, yet free from rigid constraints. This allows them to
                        express a vibrant and transformative vision that challenges conventions and inspires awe.

                        factory, drawing a deliberate and obvious parallel to Andy Warhol’s Factory. Both Factory of Art
                        and Warhol’s Factory share a common setting: repurposed industrial spaces. But the similarities
                        run deeper. They both explore the potential of language through innovative media, grounded in a
                        vision of reality as an aesthetic construct that fosters the interconnection between art,
                        industry, and other human expressions.

                    Like Warhol’s factory, Factory of Art is more than just a physical space; it’s a state of mind, an

                    through the synergy of highly skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds, united by a shared
                    creative ideal. The result is the creation of new languages, expressed in both contents and
                    materials, using contemporary technological mediums.

                    <h2>OUR SHAPES</h2>
                    <h3>SQUARE AND CIRCLE</h3>
                    <p>
                        The circle that protrudes from the square is an eye and symbolizes looking at things. The part
                        on the outside of the square is the cornea, the first lens to encounter light, placed in front
                        of the pupil, the open door to the outside world from which the internal process that enables
                        the perception and formation of images begins, starting with the light impulses passed through
                        the lens of the crystalline lens and then focused on the retina and sent via the optic nerve to
                        the brain, which processes them and returns the image by orienting it in the “right direction.”
                        The diameter of the pupil varies with the intensity of the light, but it is also influenced by
                        emotions, moods and thoughts; it is the aperture open to the world and this connects it directly
                        to the camera whose operation reproduces in its intent at its most basic state that of the human
                        eye. With the substantial difference that in this case the 'inversion of the incoming image from
                        the lens system is then straightened by the sensor. From a conceptual point of view, the Factory
                        of Art logo represents in the first instance an invitation to a change of point of view, of
                        looking at things, to a reversal of reality, a concept that is fully realized in the word ART,
                        the soul of the Factory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the reversal of reality and a new look at things, Factory thus arrives at the creation
                        of a new world, hence the payoff: WE CREATE WORLDS. In short, a design process in which the
                        initial perception of reality by passing through lenses and filters of conscious structured work
                        and artistic freedom manages to unify the different conceptual/professional structures of the
                        founders of Factory of Art into a single strand of thought in constant synergy:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taken on their own they are not dynamic figures, they are closed, but the moment the circle is
                        inserted into the square it determines a shape that expresses a new dynamism, and its position
                        clarifies its precise meaning: the circle that protrudes from the side of the square connotes
                        all disciplines in the field of visual arts at the Factory of Art (because of the reference to
                        the eye/perception), while when it protrudes upward it takes on the connotation of matter; on a
                        symbolic level it recalls a stereolithographic 3d printer (first printer to go on the market in
                        1987). On a conceptual level, it represents the design activities of the Factory Of Art.

                    <h2>OUR COLORS</h2>
                    <h3>YELLOW VANGOGH</h3>
                    <p>
                        The choice of yellow encompasses more emotional aspects that influence artistic freedom, of
                        making. Yellow for Van Gogh was an obsession, the artist's chromesthesia played a primary role
                        in the rendering of his work, in fact, he perceived colours as both visual and auditory stimuli:
                        sounds had colours and some like yellow and blue were to his senses like fireworks. He perceived
                        the world differently, which is why he saw yellow as more than just a colour. In fact, for the
                        chroma-esthetic artist, colours take on a strongly emotional tone and at the same time an
                        absolute concreteness that invades the work with great power and involves the viewer even if he
                        or she does not perceive colours as he or she does. It is this aspect of seeing things outside
                        of the defined and known appearance translated from Van Gogh's experience that guided the choice
                        of yellow for the logo, in addition to the fact that it represents light, creativity, the will
                        to act, and the transformation of thought into matter. Someone who loves yellow is an innovator,
                        a creative person, and a visionary with a strong desire to materialize his or her point of view.
                        In nature it is one of the three colours immediately perceived by the human eye, it does not
                        blend in, but always advances in perspective, and therefore for Factory of Art it also
                        represents the continuous movement toward a constant quest for improvement, the function that
                        induces concreteness through the filter of positivity and vitality by opening to a more vivid
                        imagination.

                    <h3>BLUE KLEIN</h3>
                    <p>
                        Klein Blue IKB, the purest expression of this colour, embodies the vision of the great French
                        artist Yves Klein, who elevated the importance of colour in art to an absolute level through
                        design. Our logo, it symbolizes rationality and structured work, paving the way for new
                        journeys. It is the colour of infinite space, capable of encompassing everything. For Klein, it
                        transcends dimensions, representing the sky and sea—nature’s most abstract entities. This
                        powerful and intense colour invades real and mental spaces, merging art with life. For Klein, a
                        new world demands a new man, one who is attuned to art's spiritual and immaterial energy, using
                        it to challenge the boundaries of matter, time, and convention. Thus, in the design intent of
                        our logo, there is the freedom to go beyond the obvious and fill the space that colour
                        represents with innovative ideas.
